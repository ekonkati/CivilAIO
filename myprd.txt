PART 4 — UNIFIED DATA MODEL (UDM): CORE REPRESENTATION (Detailed PRD) 
Master Structural + Architectural + Estimation + Workflow + Project Management 
Data Model 
This part defines the single source of truth for the entire application— 
from concept → architectural layout → structural model → analysis → design → 
estimation → execution → closure. 
It is the backbone that makes the app behave like a fusion of: 
• STAAD / ETABS / Robot Structural Analysis / Tekla (structural modeling + 
analysis) 
• Revit / AutoCAD Architecture (architectural layouts + parametric modeling) 
• CPWD/State SSR Estimation Engines 
• Primavera/MSP-like Workflows 
• BIM-enabled lifecycle management 
Everything flows through this UDM. 
 
4.1 Objectives of the Unified Data Model 
The UDM must: 
1. Represent ANY structure type 
o RCC buildings (G+1 to G+40) 
o Steel buildings / PEB 
o Industrial sheds 
o Retaining walls 
o RE walls 
o Landfills 
o Water tanks 
o Compound walls 
o Foundations 
o Staircases 
o Bridges (future) 
o Roads (future) 
2. Be fully parametric 
o Editable like STAAD 
o Re-generatable layouts 
o Auto-update drawings & quantities on every change 
3. Enable AI-driven refinement 
o The user says: “G+2 building in Hyderabad” 
o AI expands → UDM → model builder → design → drawings → quantities 
4. Unify structural + architectural + MEP placeholders 
(Even if MEP is a placeholder for Phase-1) 
5. Allow modular monetization 
o Architectural only 
o Structural design only 
o Estimation only 
o Execution management only 
o Full package (discounted) 
o Add-on services (peer review, expert assistance, permit set) 
 
4.2 High-Level Structure of the UDM

DETAILED PRD — PART 4 
UNIFIED DATA MODEL (UDM) & STRUCTURAL DIGITAL TWIN CORE** 
This section defines the single source of truth for every building/structure the system 
handles. 
Everything the system does—AI reasoning, layout generation, design, analysis, 
estimation, drawings, scheduling—depends on this UDM. 
This is the heart of the entire app. 
 
4.1 Purpose of the UDM 
The Unified Data Model (UDM) acts as: 
• The digital twin of the project 
• The master container for all inputs, derived data, analysis artefacts, results, and 
documents 
• A schema-driven layer that ensures consistency across all modules: 
o AI Conversational Input Engine 
o Architectural Layout Engine 
o Structural Modeling Engine 
o Analysis Engine (Kratos / FEniCSx / OpenSeesPy future support) 
o Design Engine (IS/ACI/AISC/EC) 
o Estimation Engine (SSR/state SOR, CPWD, AP/TG/KA/MH/DELHI SOR) 
o Drawings Engine (AutoCAD/DXF/SVG) 
o Project Execution Engine (Schedules, BOQ integration) 
The UDM ensures any structure type can be defined using one backbone. 
 
4.2 Core Concepts 
The UDM is composed of three layers: 
 
Layer A — User Intent & AI Normalization Layer 
This layer captures natural language inputs and converts them into structured context. 
Example input: 
“Construction of G+2 building in Hyderabad” 
AI normalizes into: 
{ 
  "project_type": "RCC Building", 
  "usage": "Residential", 
  "location": "Hyderabad", 
  "height": "G+2", 
  "estimated_floors": 3, 
  "climatic_zone": "Seismic Zone II, Wind Zone 39 m/s", 
  "required_drawings": ["Architectural", "Structural", "Estimation"], 
  "user_preferences": { 
      "foundation_type": "As per soil report or pad footing default", 
      "floor_height": 3.0, 
      "parking_requirement": "Ground floor" 
  } 
} 
This becomes the seed for layout generation and modeling. 
 
Layer B — Structural Data Schema (Universal Across RCC/PEB/Landfill/RE Wall) 
The UDM defines the structure as a hierarchy: 
UDM Level 0: Project Metadata 
project_id 
project_name 
location 
topography 
usage_type 
building_category 
importance_factor 
client_details 
 
UDM Level 1: Geometry Objects 
1. Building Envelope 
footprint_polygon 
storey_heights 
number_of_storeys 
plinth_level 
terrace_level 
basement_info 
setbacks 
2. Functional Spaces 
rooms: [ 
  { name, area, function, floor, adjacency } 
] 
circulation: { 
  stairs, lifts, corridors 
} 
parking: { type, capacity } 
3. Load Paths 
load_transfer_paths: { 
  slabs → beams → columns → footings 
} 
 
UDM Level 2: Structural Components 
All structural members are stored as standardized objects. 
Columns 
{ 
  id, floor, size, axis, material, grade, 
  loads: { axial, moment, shear }, 
  design_results: {}, 
  analysis_results: {} 
} 
Beams 
{ 
  id, 
  span_coordinates, 
  section_properties, 
  support_conditions, 
  load_cases, 
  design_results 
} 
Slabs 
{ 
  id, 
  slab_type: one_way/two_way/flat_slab, 
  thickness, 
  reinforcement, 
  loading 
} 
Foundations 
{ 
  id, 
  type: isolated/combined/raft/pile, 
  soil_properties, 
  bearing_capacity, 
  uplift_check, 
  settlement_check 
} 
PEB Frames 
{ 
  frame_id, 
  column_section, 
  rafter_section, 
  haunch_details, 
  purlin_type, 
  wind_bracing_scheme 
} 
Retaining Structures 
{ 
  height, 
  soil, 
  surcharge, 
  wall_geometry, 
  stability_results 
} 
Landfill Cells 
{ 
  polygon, 
  benches, 
  slopes, 
  bunds, 
  stability_factors, 
  leachate_details 
} 
 
UDM Level 3: Analysis Layer 
Analysis engine (Kratos/FEniCSx) writes results back in: 
analysis_cases: [ 
   { 
      "case_name": "DL+LL", 
      "nodal_displacements": [...], 
      "member_forces": [...], 
      "stress_contours": { path_to_vtk }, 
      "reactions": [...], 
      "mode_shapes": [...] 
   } 
] 
 
UDM Level 4: Design Layer 
For each code: 
design_results: { 
   IS800: { beam_checks, column_checks, bolt_design }, 
   IS456: { slabs, beams, columns, footing }, 
   IS1893: { base_shear, drift, torsion }, 
   ACI318: { optional }, 
   AISC360: { optional } 
} 
 
UDM Level 5: Drawings Layer 
drawings: { 
  architectural: ["floor_plan.svg", "elevation1.svg", "sections.svg"], 
  structural: ["beam_layout.dxf", "column_layout.dxf"], 
  footing_detail: ["footing_f1.dxf"], 
  rebar_schedules: ["bar_bending_schedule.xlsx"] 
} 
 
Layer 6: Estimation + BOQ 
Each object computes its own quantity: 
boq = [ 
  { "item": "Concrete M25", "qty": 78.5, "unit": "m3", "rate": 7800, "amount": ... }, 
  { "item": "Steel Fe500", "qty": 4.2, "unit": "t", "rate": 65000 }, 
  ... 
] 
SSR rates come from: 
• Telangana SSR 
• Andhra SSR 
• Karnataka SSR 
• Maharashtra SSR 
• Delhi DSR 2023 
• CPWD DSR 
 
4.3 Why This UDM Works for All Structure Types 
Because it is: 
  Extensible 
• Add new object types (tanks, chimneys, warehouses) easily. 
  AI-friendly 
• Every field is introspectable by a LLM: 
o “Find all beams failing in bending” 
o “Optimize this structural system using steel vs RCC comparison” 
  Analysis-Engine Agnostic 
The same UDM can feed: 
• Kratos 
• FEniCSx 
• OpenSeesPy (optional) 
• STAAD import/export 
• ETABS (later) 
  Drawings + Estimation + Schedules All Feed From the Same Data 
No duplication, no mismatches.

type: "Retaining Wall" 
type: "Composite Structure" 
type: "Bridge" 
 
SUMMARY OF PART 4 
This part establishes the data backbone for the entire platform. 
Every design, drawing, estimation, and analysis step uses this UDM. 
  
PART 5 – Functional Requirements: AI Intake & Requirements Capture 
This part defines how the AI layer will understand a vague user statement like: 
“G+2 residential building in Hyderabad” 
and convert it into fully structured requirements that drive design, estimation, and 
project management, and how it fits with all structural modules (PEB, RCC, landfills, 
etc.) we discussed earlier. 
 
5.1 Objectives of AI Intake Layer 
1. Convert natural language intent into structured project data. 
2. Automatically drive the user through only the questions that matter for their 
chosen journey: 
o Full design (architecture + structural + detail drawings + BoQ + project 
plan), or 
o Estimation-only, or 
o Execution/project management only. 
3. Support multi-structure requirements: 
o G+2 RCC building + compound wall + septic tank 
o Industrial shed/PEB + office block + retaining wall + landfill platform, etc. 
4. Keep the platform modular for billing: 
o Each step (concept plan, architectural, structural, detailed, estimation, 
execution) is a separate billable module. 
 
5.2 High-Level AI Workflow 
1. User entry message 
o Example: “I want to construct a G+2 residential building in Hyderabad on 
a 40x60 site.” 
2. Intent classification by AI: 
o Project type: Residential / Commercial / Industrial / Mixed-use. 
o Structure family: RCC Building / PEB / Composite / Landfill / RE Wall / etc. 
o Desired path: 
▪ (a) Design → Estimate → Execution 
▪ (b) Design only 
▪ (c) Estimate only (user already has drawings) 
▪ (d) Execution + monitoring only (user already has DPR & BoQ) 
3. Guided question tree (AI-driven): 
o AI progressively asks only the relevant questions: 
▪ Location, dimensions, floors, occupancy, soil info, budget, codes, 
etc. 
4. Input enrichment: 
o AI converts free text, uploaded sketches, or plans into: 
▪ Site boundary, 
▪ Floor-wise usage, 
▪ Structural system assumptions, 
▪ Modules required (retaining wall? water tank? overhead tank? PEB 
shed?). 
5. Requirements freeze & package selection: 
o AI proposes a “solution pack”: 
▪ e.g., “Architectural floor plans + 3D views + structural design (RCC) 
+ BoQ + SSR-based estimate + Gantt schedule.” 
o User can accept/edit modules → this drives billing. 
6. Trigger downstream engines: 
o Architectural generator 
o Structural generator (Kratos/other engine under the hood) 
o Estimation engine 
o Project execution engine 
 
5.3 AI Intake – Detailed Functional Requirements 
5.3.1 Input Types Supported 
• Text prompts: 
o “G+2 residential in Hyderabad.” 
o “Industrial warehouse 60x120 m PEB shed in Pune.” 
• Parametric forms: 
o Predefined dropdowns for users who don’t want chat: 
▪ Building type, floors, area, location, soil type, etc. 
• Uploads: 
o Image/PDF of hand sketch. 
o DWG/DXF or simple plan. 
o Excel/CSV with room schedule or functional requirements. 
AI responsibilities: 
• Parse all inputs. 
• Extract structured data. 
• Detect missing critical info and ask focused follow-ups. 
 
5.3.2 Requirement Graph (Conceptual) 
The AI will maintain an internal Project Requirement Graph: 
• Project node: 
o Project ID, Title, Location, Client type, Stage. 
• Site node: 
o Plot boundary, setbacks, road(s), zoning constraints. 
• Built space nodes: 
o Blocks (A/B/C), each with: 
▪ Usage (residential, office, industrial, etc.) 
▪ Floors & floor heights 
▪ Occupancy loads 
• Structure nodes: 
o RCC building, PEB, composite frame, retaining walls, RE walls, tanks, 
landfills, etc. 
• Functionality nodes: 
o Staircases, lifts, water tanks, OHT, compound walls, UG tanks, ramps, 
basements, podiums. 
• Service nodes (optional future phase): 
o MEP, fire-fighting, HVAC, plumbing. 
AI converts free text into this graph and keeps it updated as user answers more 
questions. 
 
5.3.3 Question Flow Examples 
Example 1 – G+2 Residential in Hyderabad 
1. AI: “You want a G+2 residential building in Hyderabad. 
Is it for single-family, multi-family (apartments), or mixed-use (shops + 
residence)?” 
2. User: “Single-family.” 
3. AI follows the single-family template: 
o Site size (length x width)? 
o Corner plot or single road? 
o Approximate budget? 
o Soil type known? (Rock/medium/soft) 
o Parking requirements (ground floor parking or stilt)? 
o Number of bedrooms per floor, special spaces (home office, pooja, etc.)? 
4. AI builds a structured requirement set and offers: 
o “I can generate concept floor plans, structural concept, and a preliminary 
cost estimate. 
Do you want all three, or just any specific ones?” 
User selection drives which modules to activate. 
 
Example 2 – Industrial PEB + Retaining Wall + Landfill 
1. User: “Need a 60x120m PEB warehouse with G+1 office and a landfill platform 
with retaining walls.” 
2. AI: 
o Splits into sub-projects under one parent: 
▪ Sub-project 1: PEB warehouse (60 x 120 m). 
▪ Sub-project 2: RCC office block (G+1). 
▪ Sub-project 3: Retaining walls. 
▪ Sub-project 4: Landfill platform (CPHEEO/CPCB). 
o Asks specific questions per structure type. 
3. User chooses: 
o “Design + estimate for PEB and office. Only design (no estimate) for 
landfill.” 
System activates only those design + estimation modules. 
 
5.3.4 Module Selection & Billing Logic 
• Each logical block is a module: 
1. Requirement capture & conceptual proposal (free or minimal flat fee). 
2. Architectural layout generation. 
3. Structural design: 
▪ RCC module 
▪ Steel/PEB module 
▪ Composite module 
▪ Special modules (retaining wall, RE wall, landfill, tank, chimney). 
4. Detailed drawings (GA, reinforcement, connection details, etc.). 
5. Estimation/BoQ: 
▪ SSR-based or custom rate library. 
6. Execution management: 
▪ Schedule, site logs, quality, billing, etc. 
• AI suggests a default pack based on use case; user can add/remove modules. 
• Pricing model: 
o Per module per project OR subscription + per-project credits. 
• App must: 
o Track active modules per project. 
o Enforce feature access based on purchased modules. 
 
5.3.5 “Jump Directly to Estimation” Path 
Requirement: 
User may say, “I already have drawings; I just want an estimate.” 
AI behavior: 
1. Detects estimation-only intent. 
2. Asks: 
o Do you have BoQ? 
▪ If yes, import and map to SSR. 
▪ If no, ask for drawings (PDF/DWG) or room-wise data. 
3. Required inputs: 
o Location, SSR/state, year. 
o Drawing set or basic quantities. 
4. Skip all design modules; directly enter Estimation Engine. 
5. Option: AI offers optional upsell: 
o “Based on your drawings, we can also perform independent design 
check for an additional fee.” 
 
5.4 AI Orchestration Within the System 
5.4.1 Integration Points 
• AI Layer sits above: 
o Design engine(s) (which may internally use Kratos/FEniCSx etc.). 
o Estimation engine. 
o Execution engine. 
• It should: 
o Maintain conversation state (project context). 
o Update the Project Requirement Graph. 
o Call backend APIs to: 
▪ Create/update Project. 
▪ Create/update Sub-structures. 
▪ Trigger design runs. 
▪ Trigger estimation runs. 
5.4.2 Memory & Multi-session Handling 
• Project ID is the anchor. 
• AI should remember: 
o User preferences (state SSR, typical floor plans, preferred structural 
system). 
o Previously uploaded drawings. 
• For returning users: 
o “Do you want to continue with Project P-2025-0012 (G+2 Hyderabad) or 
start a new one?” 
 
5.5 Non-Functional Requirements for AI Intake 
• Explainability: 
o AI must show a summary of captured requirements before triggering 
design: 
▪ “Here is how I understood your project…” with an editable 
checklist. 
• Validation: 
o Hard constraints: 
▪ No negative dimensions. 
▪ Check FSI/zoning issues where simple rules are known (optional 
advanced feature). 
• Performance: 
o First response < 3 seconds where possible. 
o Full requirement capture usually 3–10 exchanges. 
• Language Support (future but design now): 
o English + regional languages (Telugu, Hindi, etc.). 
• Logging: 
o Store all critical prompts & outputs for QA and audit (important for 
engineering validation). 
 
5.6 Deliverables for This Part 
• AI requirement capture flows for: 
o G+2 RCC residential in Indian city. 
o Industrial PEB + office. 
o Building + retaining walls + landfill. 
• JSON schema for Project Requirement Graph. 
• API specs: 
o POST /ai/intake/session/start 
o POST /ai/intake/step 
o GET /project/{id}/requirements 
o POST /project/{id}/modules/select

(rooms, walls, openings, furniture zones, shafts, circulation, etc.) 
c) Non-structural but essential project elements 
(floors, zones, grids, levels, utility networks, workflows, tasks, cost objects) 
d) Their relationships 
(how beams attach to nodes, how slabs sit on beams, how walls attach to slabs, how 
spaces relate to floors, how drawings map to entities)

PART 7 — LOAD ENGINE ARCHITECTURE 
A Unified, Code-Compliant, Extensible, Multi-Structure Loading System 
 
7.1 Purpose of the Load Engine 
The Load Engine is the system that: 
1. Collects user inputs & derived configuration 
(Building type, location, geometry, purpose, occupancy, soil data, roof type, 
layout.) 
2. Generates all necessary load cases & combinations as per relevant codes: 
o IS 875 (Parts 1–5) for Indian projects 
o IS 1893 for seismic 
o IRC, AASHTO, Eurocode, UBC, IBC, ASCE, etc. for global users 
o Special modules for: 
▪ Landfills (unit weight, surcharge, leachate, wind over exposed 
dump) 
▪ Retaining walls (earth pressure, hydrodynamic, live surcharge) 
▪ RE walls (pullout forces, connection loads) 
▪ PEB (wind loads on frames, cladding pressures, suction zones) 
▪ Industrial buildings (crane loads, hanging loads, mezzanine) 
▪ Water tanks (hydrostatic + hydrodynamic) 
▪ Solar structures (panel loads + wind + ballast) 
3. Converts loads into analysis-ready formats 
For whichever solver is selected: 
o Kratos Multiphysics (preferred per your latest instruction) 
o FEniCSx (optional future backend) 
o OpenSeesPy (legacy fallback) 
4. Stores loads in a unified data structure (UDM-Load).

7.7 Extensibility Architecture 
The load engine is built using a modular adapter pattern: 
Base class 
BaseLoadModel 
 ├── compute_dead_load() 
 ├── compute_live_load() 
 ├── compute_wind_load() 
 ├── compute_seismic_load() 
 ├── compute_special_loads() 
 ├── generate_load_combinations() 
 └── export_to_solver() 
Derived classes 
RCCBuildingLoadModel(BaseLoadModel) 
PEBLoadModel(BaseLoadModel) 
LandfillLoadModel(BaseLoadModel) 
RetainingWallLoadModel(BaseLoadModel) 
REWallLoadModel(BaseLoadModel) 
TankLoadModel(BaseLoadModel) 
Each derived class overrides only what it needs. 
 
7.8 Real-Time Intelligence 
The engine intelligently adapts loads using AI: 
1. Predicts which loads apply 
Based on the structure type, occupancy, country, and behavior. 
2. Suggests missing data 
Example: 
“You selected G+2 building. Please specify soil type to compute seismic loads.” 
3. Offers load optimization 
o Suggests lighter sections 
o Suggests mezzanine load reductions 
o Suggests alternative roof profiles 
 
7.9 Integration with the Workflow 
Once loads are generated: 
1. Geometry → 
2. Load Engine → 
3. Analysis (Kratos) → 
4. Design → 
5. Drawings → 
6. Estimation → 
7. Project Management 
Users may: 
• Use load generator only

into: 
• Member Capacity Checks 
• Section Optimizations 
• Connection Design 
• Stability Checks 
• Foundation Design 
• Detailing Rules 
• Design Reports (IS / ACI / AISC / EC format) 
The engine must be flexible enough to design any structural system: 
• RCC G+2 building

• Composite structures 
• Retaining walls, RE walls 
• Industrial structures 
• Landfills (stability + geotechnical modules) 
• Customized user-defined buildings imported from plan/sketch 
 
9.2 HIGH-LEVEL ARCHITECTURAL OVERVIEW 
The Design Engine consists of 7 Sub-Engines: 
1. Design Input Interpreter 
2. Material & Section Classification Engine 
3. Code Rulebook Engine (IS / ACI / AISC / EC) 
4. Member Capacity Engine 
5. Connection Design Engine 
6. Foundation Design Engine 
7. Design Documentation & Hand-Calculation Generator 
These engines run in sequence, but also support re-runs, backtracking, edits, recalculations
and optimizations. 
 
9.3 DESIGN INPUT INTERPRETER 
This module converts: 
• User manual inputs 
• AI-derived building information 
• Extracted geometry 
• Structural 3D model

12.4 Template Inheritance (Very Important) 
The system will support parent–child template structures. 
Example 
parent: rcc_building/base.yaml 
child: rcc_building/g+2_small_office.yaml 
Inheritance rule: 
• Child overrides only what is needed 
• Base file holds defaults 
This enables: 
• Faster updates 
• Consistency 
• Uniformity across thousands of templates 
 
12.5 Template-Based Model Generation (like STAAD) 
Once a template loads: 
System auto-generates: 
• Nodes 
• Members 
• Surfaces 
• Supports 
• Load patterns 
• Load combinations 
• Material assignments 
User can then modify: 
• Grid spacing 
• Nodes 
• Beams/columns 
• Slabs 
• Loads 
3D Visualization Features 
• Orbit 
• Pan 
• Zoom 
• Select element 
• Modify geometry 
• Cut sections (XZ, YZ, XY) 
• Member property view 
• Highlight overstressed elements 
After modifications 
User clicks “Proceed to Design →” 
and the design engine (Part 9) takes over. 
 
12.6 AI-Assisted Template Recommendation 
When user inputs: 
“Construction of G+2 building in Hyderabad” 
The system triggers: 
AI Step 1 — Parse requirement 
structure_type = RCC 
levels = 3 
location = Hyderabad 
AI Step 2 — Query template library 
Finds all “RCC G+2” models. 
AI Step 3 — Auto-suggest top 5 layouts 
• Typical residential 3BHK grid 
• Typical office layout 
• Narrow plot plan 
• Wide plot plan 
• Parking + 2 floors 
AI Step 4 — Convert selected layout → structural template 
AI Step 5 — Allow user to upload hand sketch 
AI converts sketch to: 
• Grid lines 
• Rooms 
• Wall positions 
• Openings 
• Column markers 
 
12.7 Template Pricing Model 
Every template links to monetization: 
• Architectural Plan – ₹ X 
• Structural Plan – ₹ Y 
• Detailing – ₹ Z 
• Estimation – ₹ A 
• Project Management – ₹ B 
• 3D Visualisation – ₹ C 
User pays only for the activated modules. 
 
12.8 Template Versioning & Updates 
Each template has: 
• Version number 
• Created by 
• Last revised by 
• Changelog 
Engine always loads latest stable version unless user selects otherwise. 
 
12.9 Template–Code Compliance Integration 
Each template ties into code-specific rule-sets: 
• IS 456 / IS 800 / IS 875 / IS 1893 
• ACI 318 / AISC / Eurocode 2/3 
• CPHEEO / MoRTH / IRC 
Template → Loads → Design Checks → Drawings → Estimation. 
Zero manual intervention once the model is finalized.

     PART 19 — SECURITY, DATA INTEGRITY & COMPLIANCE FRAMEWORK 
(For the AI-Driven Structural Design, Estimation, and Project Management Platform) 
 
19.1 Purpose 
This section establishes the security, integrity, compliance, governance, and 
operational safety rules that must be followed across the entire platform — from 
architectural planning to design, estimation, project execution, document 
management, and closure. The intent is: 
• To protect user data, drawings, models, design files, SSR rates, project 
estimates, and proprietary engineering logic. 
• To ensure compliance with IS codes, IT standards, data-privacy protocols, and 
audit requirements. 
• To guarantee that all generated designs, calculations, and outputs are tamperproof,
verifiable, traceable, and audit-ready. 
This applies to all modules — Architecture, Structural Design, Kratos/FEniCSx 
Simulation Layer, Drawing Engine, Estimation, Billing, QA/QC, PMC, Procurement, 
and Execution workflows. 
 
19.2 Core Security Principles 
19.2.1 Zero-Trust Architecture 
• Every user request is authenticated. 
• Every design operation is verified. 
• No module trusts another module without explicit token-based permission. 
19.2.2 Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP) 
Each engineer or contractor only sees: 
• Their projects 
• Their permitted modules 
• Their allowed design tools 
• Their billing-activated services 
19.2.3 Defense-in-Depth 
Security is layered at: 
• UI → API → Microservices → Solver Engine → Database → Storage → Deployment → 
Backup 
19.2.4 Tamper-Proof Engineering Output

     PART 21 — COMMERCIAL MODEL, PRICING ENGINE & BILLING SYSTEM 
This part defines how the platform will monetize, price, bill, track usage, apply 
metered design credits, and manage per-module revenue streams. 
This ensures the app becomes a scalable SaaS product that charges users only for the 
engineering services they use. 
 
21.1 PURPOSE OF THIS MODULE 
The Commercial Model & Billing Engine must: 
• Monetize every design action (architecture, analysis, design, drawings, 
estimates). 
• Allow free/basic access but require credits/payment for premium structural 
tasks. 
• Charge based on usage, not subscription alone. 
• Track usage per user/project. 
• Apply enterprise licensing for consultants, companies, and institutions. 
• Integrate with Razorpay/Stripe/PayPal. 
• Maintain transparent cost sheets for users. 
This makes the platform function like a digital engineering marketplace + design 
automation SaaS. 
 
21.2 KEY CONCEPT — “PAY FOR WHAT YOU USE” ENGINEERING 
Each structural or architectural step has a cost: 
User flow example 
User says: 
“G+2 building in Hyderabad” 
App asks questions → user provides drawings / sketch → 
APP CREATES: 
1. Concept Plan 
2. Architectural 2D Plan 
3. 3D Building model 
4. Structural model (columns/footings/beams/slabs) 
5. Foundation design 
6. Detail drawings 
7. Estimation 
8. Execution schedule 
9. Billing 
10. Project tracking 
Each step has a price. 
The user pays only for the steps they use.

     PART 23 — SYSTEM-WIDE INTELLIGENCE LAYER (SWIL) 
AI-Powered Reasoning, Learning, and Cross-Module Orchestration 
This part defines the brain of the entire platform — the layer that understands user 
intent, orchestrates workflows, extracts engineering meaning from sketches and 
drawings, recommends optimizations, validates compliance, anticipates missing 
inputs, learns from previous projects, and assists engineers throughout design, 
estimation, planning, execution, and closure. 
This is a mandatory component enabling the platform to behave like a virtual structural 
engineer + architect + estimator + project manager. 
 
23.1 Purpose of the System-Wide Intelligence Layer (SWIL) 
SWIL ensures that the platform moves beyond “manual model-building” and becomes a 
guided, semi-autonomous engineering system, capable of: 
1. Understanding user intent 
• “I want a G+2 building in Hyderabad” 
• “I need a 20m clear-span industrial shed” 
• “I want to check stability of an RE Wall” 
• “I only want estimation; skip design” 
2. Asking follow-up questions 
Automatically generates structured dialogs: 
• Soil profile? 
• Site location (to get wind/seismic)? 
• Loads (live, dead, machinery, storage)? 
• Usage type (residential/industrial/commercial)? 
3. Mapping user intent → Engineering modules 
• Architectural → Space planning engine 
• Structural → Framing system identification 
• Geotechnical → Soil & foundation module 
• Estimation → SSR-driven rate analysis 
• Drawings → 2D + 3D Generator 
• Workflow → Project lifecycle generator 
4. Reducing manual modelling through automation 
• Suggests column grids 
• Suggests best-fit framing layouts 
• Suggests PEB or RCC depending on span/economy 
• Auto-detects missing inputs and requests them 
5. Real-time engineering validation 
• Detects under/over-designed members 
• Warns about IS 875/IS 456/IS 1893 non-compliance 
• Validates architectural → structural consistency 
• QA/QC rule engine for every module 
6. End-to-end process orchestration 
• From input → layout → model → design → drawings → BOQ → execution plan 
• Allows skipping stages (e.g., estimation only)

     PART 33 – MULTI-STRUCTURE UNIFIED DESIGN ENGINE (MSUDE) 
A Central Intelligence Layer that Converts Any User Requirement Into a Coherent 
Structural System, Analysis Model, and Design Workflow 
 
33.1 Purpose of MSUDE 
This module acts as the brain of the entire platform. 
Because your app handles: 
• PEB Steel Buildings 
• RCC G+1, G+2, G+5… buildings 
• Industrial sheds 
• Composite buildings 
• Retaining walls 
• RE walls 
• Water tanks & sumps 
• Staircases 
• Foundations of all types (isolated, combined, raft, pile) 
• Landfills & bunds 
• Roads, pavements, drains 
• Any user-uploaded building plan 
…the design engine must unify all of them into a single core logic, ensuring: 
1. Consistent modelling logic 
2. Consistent design workflow 
3. Consistent checking logic (codes, failure modes, safety) 
4. Consistent data formats for visualization and drawing generation 
5. Consistent interoperability formats (STAAD import/export, IFC, DXF) 
MSUDE ensures that no matter what structure the user requests, the design workflow 
is predictable, validated, and automatable. 
 
33.2 High-Level Function 
MSUDE performs the following: 
1. Interprets the user requirement 
Example: “G+2 residential building in Hyderabad, 40x60 plot, 2 flats per floor” 
2. Generates a Structural Typology Tree: 
Component Options Identified Chosen by Engine 
Structural system RCC framed / shear wall / composite RCC framed 
Slab type One-way / Two-way / Flat slab Two-way 
Staircase type Dogleg / Open-well Dogleg 
Foundation Isolated / Combined / Raft / Pile Isolated 
Lateral system Moment frames / Shear walls Moment frames 
Special elements Retaining wall at front Yes 
3. Creates a Unified FEM Model Descriptor 
MSUDE converts the typology into a mesh definition, boundary conditions, and 
loads settings. 
4. Passes the descriptor to the selected solver 
o Kratos Multiphysics (preferred) 
o FEniCSx (secondary) 
o STAAD-like model (export) 
o IFC (export) 
5. Receives results, validates them, re-runs if unstable. 
6. Triggers design checks 
Based on IS 456, IS 800, IS 875, IS 1893, etc. 
7. Passes clean “Design Decisions” to the Drawing Generator 
o Beam sizes 
o Column sizes 
o Footing dimensions 
o Reinforcement 
o Steel member sizes 
8. Passes “Final Quantities” to Estimation Engine 
o Concrete 
o Steel 
o Shuttering 
o Masonry 
o Finishes

     PART 36 — FAILURE MODES, SAFETY CHECKS & ENGINEERING VALIDATION 
ENGINE 
This section defines the built-in system responsible for identifying, flagging, and 
quantifying structural failures, serviceability violations, constructability risks, and code 
non-compliances across all supported structure types (RCC, Steel, PEB, Composite, 
Landfills, Retaining Walls, RE Walls, Bridges, Industrial Sheds, Warehouses, etc.). 
The Failure Modes & Validation Engine must operate independently of the design 
engine and must be capable of: 
1. Stand-alone post-processing (for models imported from STAAD, Etabs, 
SAP2000, Robot, Tekla, or any other tool). 
2. Inline real-time checks while the user is modelling in the app's 2D/3D editor. 
3. Batch validation for multiple models in automated workflows (AI-driven). 
 
36.1 Purpose & Objectives 
The engine must: 
• Detect unsafe design conditions. 
• Identify code violations as per IS / IRC / ACI / AISC / Eurocode. 
• Evaluate serviceability failures (deflection, crack width, drift, settlement). 
• Provide failure-specific recommendations.

     PART 36 COMPLETED 
  
     PART 37 — AI–POWERED DESIGN HINT ENGINE (GUIDED QUERY 
ORCHESTRATION) 
(A core system that asks the user the right questions, understands intent, clarifies 
missing inputs, and automatically converts incomplete statements into full engineeringready
data.) 
 
37.1 Purpose & Vision 
Most users will begin with vague or incomplete statements: 
• “I want to build a G+2 house in Hyderabad.” 
• “I need a factory shed about 120x80.” 
• “I’m planning a retaining wall for my site.” 
This module is the brain that turns such natural language statements into: 
• A complete structural design brief, 
• A structured engineering parameter set, 
• A mapped design workflow, 
• Selection of correct codebooks, templates, and modules, 
• And a prioritized questionnaire to fill missing details. 
This becomes the first step before Geometry Builder, Analysis Engine, and Drawing 
Engine. 
 
37.2 Functional Objectives 
✔ 37.2.1 Natural Language → Engineering Intent Extraction 
The system automatically extracts: 
• Structure Type (RCC/Steel/PEB/Landfill/RE Wall/Retaining Wall/etc.) 
• Storeys / spans / bays / functional requirements 
• Site location (map → wind/seismic/SBC defaults) 
• Usage category (residential / industrial / institutional / warehousing) 
• Expected loads (or allow defaults) 
• Constraints (plot size, height limits, setbacks, fire norms) 
• Local code requirements (IS, NBC, EC, etc.) 
If user says: 
“G+2 building in Hyderabad for residential use on 200 sq yd plot.” 
System automatically infers: 
• Structure → RCC building 
• Location → Hyderabad → Wind zone 39 m/s, Seismic Zone II 
• Plot area → 167 m² 
• Usage → Residential → Live load defaults 
• Typical layout → Auto-suggest 3–4 room layouts 
• Soil type → Ask or assume medium (ask confirmation)

     PART 38 — MODEL CHECKING & VALIDATION ENGINE 
This module ensures that every model—Architectural, Structural, Services, Site, 
BIM, 3D, FEM, Kratos-based, or user-uploaded—passes through a multi-layer 
validation pipeline before advancing to design, estimation, or execution workflows. 
This is mandatory to meet real-world expectations of engineers, architects, contractors, 
peer-review consultants, statutory authorities, and clients.

     PART 39 — ADVANCED AI REASONING ENGINE & KNOWLEDGE-GRAPH BASED 
DECISION LAYER 
Part 39 introduces the AI Reasoning Core, which becomes the “brain” of your entire 
Design → Estimate → Execute → Close-Out workflow. 
This module enables the system to understand, infer, recommend, query, and explain 
all engineering, architectural, construction management, and project-control logic 
used throughout the platform. 
This is NOT a basic LLM integration. 
This is a structured, standards-driven, rules-based, multi-modal engineering 
intelligence layer. 
 
39.1 PURPOSE OF THE AI REASONING ENGINE 
The AI Reasoning Engine (AIRE) is responsible for: 
1. Understanding user project intent 
Examples: 
• “Construction of G+2 building in Hyderabad…” 
• “Industrial shed 40m × 120m with mezzanine…” 
• “RE wall required along south boundary…” 
AIRE interprets the instructions and breaks them into: 
• Structural components 
• Functional requirements 
• Architectural expectations 
• Site constraints 
• Applicable codes (IS/IRC/MoRTH/NEC/IBC/Eurocode, etc.) 
• Execution requirements 
• Costing regimes 
• Timelines 
2. Generating missing questions automatically 
AIRE determines what additional information is required: 
• Soil conditions 
• Functional loads 
• Basements 
• Clear heights 
• Column grid preference 
• Staircase locations 
• Fire requirements 
• Ventilation, water tank, service rooms 
• Site access & circulation 
• Green norms, EHS norms 
• Urban bylaws 
• Parking & setbacks 
It asks the user until data is complete. 
3. Converting user intent → Engineering Objects 
AIRE generates: 
• Column grids 
• Load cases 
• Structural systems 
• RCC vs Steel vs Composite recommendation 
• Preliminary sizing 
• Architectural space zoning 
• Boundary & contour extraction (if site KML provided) 
4. Interpreting uploaded plans / hand sketches 
Using: 
• Vision Transformer (ViT) 
• CNN-based plan extraction 
• OCR for dimension reading 
• Edge/contour detection 
• Line-weight classification 
• Symbol classification 
AIRE converts the drawing into: 
• Rooms 
• Levels 
• Slabs 
• Beams 
• Columns 
• Openings 
• Doors/Windows 
• Stairs 
• Water tanks 
• Compound wall / gate layout 
5. Producing engineering reasoning explanations 
AIRE justifies: 
• Why the load path is chosen 
• Why column spacing changes 
• Why shear walls suggested 
• Why pile foundation required 
• Why certain code clauses apply 
• Why a wall thickness or steel grade is recommended 
Everything is traceable. 
 
39.2 KNOWLEDGE GRAPH (KG) ARCHITECTURE 
AIRE is backed by a Construction Knowledge Graph (CKG) — the “database of 
relationships”. 
It stores: 
• Structural hierarchies 
• Load-flow logic 
• Code clauses 
• Material properties 
• Component dependencies 
• Connection rules 
• Construction sequences 
• Estimation formulas 
• Rate analysis methods 
• Site constraints

clash detection. 
3. Generate coordinated drawings, schedules, and 3D views showing discipline 
overlays. 
4. Ensure design constructability, regulatory compliance, and safety. 
5. Provide a central model that evolves from concept → design → detailed 
engineering → execution. 
This engine becomes the coordination brain of the entire platform.

43.3 Compliance Engine (IS / ACI / AISC / EC) 
This module performs a code pre-check BEFORE actual design. 
It validates: 
IS Codes 
• IS 456: RCC general provisions 
• IS 800: Steel design 
• IS 875 (1–5): Loadings 
• IS 1893: Seismic 
• IS 13920: Ductile detailing 
• IS 2911: Foundations 
• IS 1904: Soil considerations 
ACI / AISC / EuroCodes 
• ACI 318 – RCC 
• AISC 360 – Steel LRFD 
• Eurocode 2 – RCC 
• Eurocode 3 – Steel 
• Eurocode 8 – Seismic 
For each standard, system produces: 
• Compliance pass/fail 
• Warnings 
• Missing parameters 
• Suggested default values 
• Calculation references 
• Fix options 
 
43.4 AI-Driven Error Detection Mechanisms 
1. LLM-Based Structural Logic Validator 
The model is converted into a structured JSON: 
{ 
  "nodes": [...], 
  "elements": [...], 
  "materials": [...], 
  "sections": [...], 
  "spring_supports": [...], 
  "loads": [...], 
  "load_combinations": [...] 
} 
The AI detects: 
• Illogical geometry 
• Redundant elements 
• Missing supports 
• Missing load paths 
• Potential failure points 
• Imbalanced tributary distribution 
2. Vision + Geometry AI 
If user uploads: 
• Hand sketch 
• PDF drawing 
• Plan image 
The AI detects: 
• Grid layout 
• Beams/columns 
• Slab edges 
• Stairs & walls 
• Openings 
• Load-bearing walls 
• Outline geometry errors 
Then it validates the extracted model and corrects inconsistencies. 
 
43.5 Interactive 3D Validation Viewer 
Integrated into the 3D interface (Part 8): 
• Shows model errors visually 
• Elements turn Red for critical, Yellow for warnings 
• One-click correction buttons 
• Cross-section viewer displays: 
o Slenderness issues 
o Incorrect connectivity 
o Wrong boundary conditions 
Example visualization: 
• Invalid column → highlighted in red 
• Click → “Fix alignment” or “Merge nodes” 
 
43.6 Diagnostic Dashboard 
Panels 
1. Geometry Warnings 
2. Load Issues 
3. Support/Boundary Errors 
4. Design Code Conflicts 
5. FEA Stability Issues 
6. Meshing Concerns (Kratos) 
Each item comes with: 
• Screenshot preview 
• 3D camera focus link 
• Suggested fix 
• Auto-fix button 
 
43.7 Auto-Correction Engine 
AI proposes and performs corrections like: 
• Merge nodes within tolerance 
• Align columns on gridlines 
• Add missing beams 
• Auto-complete load cases 
• Recompute tributary widths 
• Replace unstable supports 
• Normalize load combinations 
• Auto-fix meshing errors in Kratos 
Every auto-correction generates: 
• Reason for correction 
• Before/after geometry snapshot 
• Code reference 
• Undo option 
 
43.8 Pre-Solver Stability Checks (Kratos) 
Before sending to the Kratos solver: 
• Check determinacy 
• Check singularities 
• Evaluate stiffness matrix conditioning 
• Detect floating nodes/elements 
• Confirm mesh validity 
• Confirm material model assignment 
• Confirm boundary condition completeness 
Outputs: 
• Pass 
• Pass with warnings 
• Fail with diagnostics + fix options 
 
43.9 Continuous Validation Loop 
Every time the user modifies the model: 
1. Model updated 
2. Validator checks consistency 
3. AI detects changes 
4. Updated warnings displayed 
5. Suggestions appear instantly 
6. User accepts or ignores 
This creates real-time design correctness enforcement.

     PART 44 — AI-Aided Construction Sequencing, Scheduling & Automation 
Module 
This module provides end-to-end AI-powered planning, sequencing, scheduling, and 
construction automation, deeply integrated with the design, estimation, and workflow 
engines. 
It ensures that after the user completes Design → Drawings → BOQ → Estimation, the 
system can automatically: 
• Generate a construction sequence 
• Create a resource-loaded schedule 
• Flag project risks 
• Auto-identify critical path 
• Produce cashflow curves 
• Simulate execution progress 
• Provide AI-based work-front management 
• Monitor delays, re-plan, re-sequence 
This is designed to function like a hybrid of Primavera P6 + MSP + BIM-4D/5D tools, but 
fully automated.

# PRD Reconciliation Log

> Populate this log after syncing `myprd.txt` to capture differences versus `prd_text.txt` and steer implementation scope.

## How to update
1. Ensure both files are present in the repo root: `prd_text.txt` and `myprd.txt`.
2. Run a diff (e.g., `diff -u prd_text.txt myprd.txt > docs/prd_delta.patch`).
3. Summarize actionable deltas below with status and owners.

## Deltas
- _Pending: awaiting `myprd.txt` sync._
